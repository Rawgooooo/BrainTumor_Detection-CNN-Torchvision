# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN (Torchvision)

## Overview
This project aims to automate the detection of brain tumors in CT scan images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch. The model classifies input brain scans as either **Tumor** or **Healthy**, helping reduce diagnostic time and error in medical imaging.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Manual diagnosis of brain tumors from MRI/CT scans is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. This project introduces an AI-powered pipeline that aids radiologists in detecting tumors with high confidence.

---

## Model Architecture
- Custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with:
  - 3 Conv2D blocks + MaxPooling
  - Batch Normalization & Dropout
  - Fully Connected Dense Layers
- Trained using `CrossEntropyLoss` and optimized with `Adam` and `ReduceLROnPlateau`.

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~97%
- **Dataset Size**: ~2,500 CT images
- **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report** show <2% false negatives (crucial for real-world deployment).

---

## Libraries Used
- `PyTorch`, `torchvision`
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `splitfolders` for dataset management
- `sklearn` for evaluation metrics
